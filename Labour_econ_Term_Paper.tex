  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item Ability bias
  
  Optimal wage depending on the worker's ability $\theta$ is : 
  
   \begin{align*}
   w(\theta) & = A h_0 e^{\theta x(\theta)} \\
   & \text{where } \\
   h_0 : & \text{ initial human capital} \\
   x(.) : & \text{ optimal length of education as a function of } \theta
   \end{align*}
  
  When $\theta$ goes up, there are two different effects : direct effect on $w(\theta)$ and indirect effect, that raises $x(\theta)$, and then affect on $w(\theta)$.
  
  Then, assume simplified form regression on loggarithm wage $w_i$ by education length $t_i$,
  
  \[ \ln w_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \epsilon_i \]
  
  $t_i$ and error term $\epsilon_i$ are positively correlated, which causes bias by OLS.
  
  \item Selection bias
  
  Consider decision-making whether to go to college or not.
  
  Define $B^i$ be the education effect for type $i \in \{ C, H \}$ individual, then we would like to specify
  
   \begin{align*}
   B^C &= E_C^C - E_H^C \\
   B^H &= E_C^H - E_H^H \\
   \end{align*}
  
  Note that $E$ is return of education, superscript standing for the type of individual, and subscript denoting her/his actual choice ( : C is to go to college, while H not).
  
  By observed sample, however, the ``appeared'' effect $B$ is :
  
  \[ B = E_C^C - E_H^H \]
  
  since type $C$ individual usually go to school and vice versa.
  
  Again, assume the wage regression
  
  \[ \ln w_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \epsilon_i \]
  
  If $E_H^C < E_H^H$, where the earnings of job for high school would have been lower for type C than for type H, then $t_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ are negatively correlated, and so $B^C$ is underestimated.
  
  Similarly, if $E_C^H < E_C^C$, then $t_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ are positively correlated, so $B^H$ is overestimated.
  
  \end{itemize}

 Exclusive instruments should have explanatory power to the independent variable you are interested in, but be independent of the error term of the original regression model.
 
 Consider the regression model
 
 \[ \ln y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \beta_2 + x_i + \epsilon_i \]
 
 Then, excluded variable $Z_i$ is introduced to the following regression :
 
 \[t_i = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Z_i + \gamma_2 + e_i \]
 
 For the excluded variable being valid, two conditions below are required :
 
  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item $\gamma_1$ is statistically significant, and not close to zero.
  
  \item $Z_i$ is independent of any variables that determines $y_i$, except for $t_i$.
  
  : $Cov(Z_i, \epsilon_i) = 0$.
  
  \end{itemize} 
 
 In order to find a valid instruments, we should pay attention to legal engagement that make individuals to apply some choice, regardless of charactaristics of each individual.

 In this paper, they utilized birth-month of the students, to identify the effect of compulsory school attendance on their ability and wages.
 
 In the U.S., those who were born early in the calender year receive compulsory education for shorter duration than those who were born late. This law is guaranteed by legal regulation about compulsory education, and there is no correlation between birth-month and their ability. Thus, using this as an instrument variable, they can limit the estimation bias.
